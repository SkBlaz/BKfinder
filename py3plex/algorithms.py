def compute_network_avp(multilayer_network):

    ## for network in multilayer, compute intra network mean shortest paths
    ## use sum (inter_network path) to sum the overall mean_path
    ## can be made run in parallel!
    ## this is used for normalization
        
    pass


def compare_by_avp(multilayer_network,sample_size,node_subsets):

    ## connected components
    ## generate sample in parallel
    ## output vector of multilayer sample avps
    ## compare with node_subset avp data
    ## perform some test to assess whether data comes from this distribution

    pass

## additional suggestions:
## avp of nodeset is summed overall
